# Rock Paper Scissors Project

this like one of the most important projects i have tackled and i hope what i have envisioned for this project will happen as i envisioned it.

**Just a little remainder that i am not english native so if you see words that you don't undrestand or makes your head go nuts just know that**

so if i explain the idea of what i want or envisioned this to look like when finished is i want first to have all the basic functionality like playing against a computer but also i want to include it so you can be able to play against your friend.

**i will include the project specifications later like the font type, font sizes and all the little details in the middle**

so the idea of this app is that lets say you're playing against a computer, when you select the rock or paper or scissors, then there comes a hand that shakes and also robot like hand to mimick a hand for the computer then it would be like playing in real life, as i said my english is not that great but hope you will undrestand what i mean when you combine it with game and play it.

ℹ️**i have decided to seperate the design info into it's own file called style-guide.md check it out if you want**

ℹ️**onething i need you to know is that most of the commit messages is generated by AI since it can generate simple clean messages faster than me and also i want to focus my energy on the logic part and not think about commit messages**
